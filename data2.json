The root causes of this problem include poorly defined alerting policies, a lack of prioritization, and inadequate suppression or grouping strategies.",

As a result, the mean time to resolution (MTTR) increases, as critical alerts may get lost in the noise.

Furthermore, it becomes difficult to distinguish between minor issues and genuinely critical incidents, leading to potential delays in addressing significant problems.",

Duplicate logs can occur in various scenarios, such as when the same event is logged by multiple services, components, or layers within an application. It can also happen when logs are produced at different log levels or by redundant logging mechanisms. This redundancy causes unnecessary log volume, which leads to increased storage and processing costs, as well as making log analysis more difficult by adding noise to the data.",

Duplicate logs can also distort analysis and metrics, leading to inaccurate reports, trends, or failure to identify genuine issues because the same log message is counted multiple times. During incident investigation, duplicate logs slow down troubleshooting and root cause analysis, as teams must sift through multiple identical entries instead of focusing on unique, actionable logs.

    "name": "No Consistent Trace ID",
    "rank": 11,
    "category": "Traces",
    "context": "This antipattern occurs when a distributed system fails to propagate a consistent trace ID across all services and components involved in a transaction. A trace ID is a unique identifier assigned to a single request or transaction that travels through multiple services, allowing teams to trace its flow and diagnose issues. Without a consistent trace ID, it becomes difficult to correlate related logs, metrics, and traces across different services, making it harder to debug issues, track performance, or understand the full journey of a request. This is typically seen when services are not properly instrumented to propagate the trace ID across service boundaries or when manual correlation is needed to connect traces from different sources.",
    "problem": "When trace IDs are not consistently propagated, teams face difficulties in correlating data across logs, metrics, and traces, hindering a comprehensive view of system behavior. Troubleshooting times increase because engineers have to manually cross-reference data from multiple services without the benefit of a consistent trace ID. This results in incomplete visibility into the flow of requests across services, making performance analysis harder. Identifying performance bottlenecks becomes a challenge, and the risk of missing issues, such as slow response times or failures, rises, as real-time tracking of requests is not possible.",
    "example": "A user submits a request to purchase an item on an e-commerce platform. The request passes through several services: authentication, inventory, payment processing, and order fulfillment. Each service logs its own data, but because the trace ID is not consistently passed from one service to the next, the logs from each service cannot be linked together. The engineering team struggles to diagnose why the payment processing is delayed since there is no unified trace showing the request flow, leading to increased time in troubleshooting.",

    "name": "Starting the Trace at the API Gateway is Overrated",
    "rank": 29,
    "category": "Traces",
    "context": "This antipattern occurs when organizations rely solely on the API Gateway as the starting point for tracing requests across their system. The API Gateway often serves as the entry point for client requests, and many systems instrument it to start the trace when a request first hits the gateway. However, this can be problematic because it doesn't provide complete visibility into the user journey or the internal workings of services that occur before or beyond the gateway. Tracing should ideally capture the entire flow of a request, including the context of intermediate services that handle the request after the gateway or before it reaches the API Gateway, such as load balancers, edge services, or even the client itself. By only starting the trace at the API Gateway, teams may miss important parts of the transaction, leading to incomplete visibility.",
    "problem": "When traces only start at the API Gateway, teams lose visibility into the full request flow prior to this point. This results in the loss of context for issues occurring before the API Gateway, such as DNS resolution failures, proxy problems, or networking issues. By not tracing the entire journey of a request, teams may miss performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities that exist before the API Gateway. It also complicates root cause analysis, as errors or performance issues originating in earlier stages become harder to pinpoint. Additionally, it may lead to false assumptions about the critical touchpoints in the request flow, narrowing the focus to the API Gateway and neglecting other important parts.",
    "example": "A user submits a request to a web application that passes through an API Gateway before reaching the backend services. The API Gateway starts the trace and records its own logs. However, before the request reaches the API Gateway, it goes through an internal load balancer that occasionally drops requests under high load, causing intermittent failures. Since the trace starts at the API Gateway, the failure in the load balancer isn't captured, leading the engineering team to spend unnecessary time troubleshooting the backend services, unaware of the issue occurring earlier in the process.",
    "recommended_solution": [
      "Start the trace earlier: Instead of starting the trace solely at the API Gateway, ensure that traces are initiated as early as possible in the request lifecycle.",
      "Instrument all relevant layers: Ensure that not just the API Gateway, but also load balancers, edge services, and client applications are properly instrumented to propagate trace IDs across the entire request flow.",
      "Use client-side tracing: In addition to server-side tracing, consider implementing client-side tracing (e.g., in web browsers or mobile apps) to capture the full journey of a request from the user's device all the way through the backend.",
