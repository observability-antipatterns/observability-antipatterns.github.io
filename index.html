    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In modern systems, observability is one of the keys to successful and scalable operations. Having real-time
        visibility into the system's performance and health is crucial, but it is often overlooked or implemented
        incorrectly. The lack of context, fragmented data, and absence of correlation between logs, metrics, and traces
        can be a major obstacle for operations and engineering teams. This catalog aims to provide a clear view of the
        common mistakes that compromise observability and ensure that teams can quickly identify these antipatterns, fix
        them, and improve the monitoring and failure diagnosis quality. The catalog is a practical guide for architects,
        software engineers, and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), enabling teams to ensure greater reliability and
        performance of their systems.</p>

    <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    <p>This catalog aims to identify and document the main observable antipatterns found in software systems, especially
        in distributed environments. With the increasing complexity of systems, observability has become essential to
        ensure the stability, performance, and security of applications. However, improper practices often lead to
        difficulties in detecting failures, analyzing incidents, and enabling continuous improvement.
        By avoiding these antipatterns, engineering teams can reduce incident resolution time, improve the quality of
        collected data, and facilitate diagnosing complex problems. This catalog serves as a guide to help identify
        inadequate practices and apply more effective solutions.</p>

    <h2>How to Use This Catalog</h2>
    <p>This catalog is organized by main observability categories, including Logs, Metrics, Tracing, Alerts, Dashboards,
        and Infrastructure Monitoring. Each antipattern is described in detail, including the context in which it
        occurs, the problems it causes, practical examples, and recommended solutions to mitigate it.
        When you find an antipattern that applies to your system, we recommend following the recommended solutions and
        practices to fix it and prevent recurrence.</p>

    <h2>Template</h2>

    <h3>Antipattern Name</h3>
    The name should be clear and objective, highlighting the main problem.
    Example: "Excessive Alerts (Alert Spam)", "Superficial Dashboards", "Outdated Infrastructure Monitoring".

    <h3>Category</h3>
    Indicates the area of observability in which the antipattern occurs. Some common categories include:

    <ul>
        <li>Logs</li>
        <li>Metrics</li>
        <li>Tracing</li>
        <li>Alerts</li>
        <li>Dashboards</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Monitoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    Describes the typical situation where the antipattern appears. Explains why teams end up adopting this practice,
    often without realizing the negative impact. It should help readers identify with the problem.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    Explains what goes wrong when this antipattern occurs. The problem should be described clearly and objectively. It
    can include negative impacts such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty in identifying issues</li>
        <li>Increased investigation time for incidents</li>
        <li>Overload of irrelevant alerts and metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    A real or fictional example that illustrates the antipattern. It could be a problematic log snippet, a misconfigured
    alert, or a dashboard that doesnâ€™t provide useful information. Ideally, it should be a concrete example that shows
    the problem in action.

    <h3>Recommended Solution</h3>
    A list of actions to correct the antipattern. It can include best practices, useful tools, and adjustments to the
    observability approach. The solution should be practical and applicable, without depending on very specific
    contexts.

    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    Explains what changes after applying the recommended solution. It divides the consequences into positive (benefits
    of the solution) and possible challenges (such as culture changes, tool adaptation, etc.).
