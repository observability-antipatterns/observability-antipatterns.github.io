    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In modern systems, observability is one of the keys to successful and scalable operations. Having real-time
        visibility into the system's performance and health is crucial, but it is often overlooked or implemented
        incorrectly. The lack of context, fragmented data, and absence of correlation between logs, metrics, and traces
        can be a major obstacle for operations and engineering teams. This catalog aims to provide a clear view of the
        common mistakes that compromise observability and ensure that teams can quickly identify these antipatterns, fix
        them, and improve the monitoring and failure diagnosis quality. The catalog is a practical guide for architects,
        software engineers, and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), enabling teams to ensure greater reliability and
        performance of their systems.</p>

    <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    <p>This catalog aims to identify and document the main observable antipatterns found in software systems, especially
        in distributed environments. With the increasing complexity of systems, observability has become essential to
        ensure the stability, performance, and security of applications. However, improper practices often lead to
        difficulties in detecting failures, analyzing incidents, and enabling continuous improvement.
        By avoiding these antipatterns, engineering teams can reduce incident resolution time, improve the quality of
        collected data, and facilitate diagnosing complex problems. This catalog serves as a guide to help identify
        inadequate practices and apply more effective solutions.</p>

    <h2>How to Use This Catalog</h2>
    <p>This catalog is organized by main observability categories, including Logs, Metrics, Traces, Alerts, Dashboards, and General. 
        The catalog is sorted by relevance, helping you quickly identify the most impactful antipatterns. Each antipattern is described 
        in detail, including the context in which it occurs, the problems it causes, practical examples, and recommended solutions to 
        mitigate it. You can filter the catalog by category, relevance, or use the free text search field to find specific antipatterns. 
        When you find an antipattern that applies to your system, we recommend following the recommended solutions and practices to fix 
        it and prevent recurrence.</p>

    <h2>Template</h2>

    <h3>Antipattern Name</h3>
    A concise and descriptive name for the anti-pattern.
    Example: "Excessive Alerts".

    <h3>Category</h3>
    The classification of the anti-pattern based on predefined categories:

    <ul>
        <li>Logs</li>
        <li>Metrics</li>
        <li>Traces</li>
        <li>Alerts</li>
        <li>Dashboards</li>
        <li>General</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Relevance</h3>
    The relevance classification is based on the number of studies that cite the antipattern:

    <ul>
        <li>High</li>
        <li>Medium</li>
        <li>Low</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    A description of the scenario where the anti-pattern occurs, including common conditions that lead to its emergence.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    The key issues caused by the anti-pattern and their impact on observability, troubleshooting, and system reliability.

    <h3>Example</h3>
    A real-world or hypothetical example illustrating how the anti-pattern manifests in practice.

    <h3>Recommended Solution</h3>
    Best practices and recommendations to mitigate or avoid the anti-pattern

    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positives</strong>: Benefits gained when addressing the anti-pattern properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Negatives</strong>: Potential difficulties in implementing the recommended solutions, such as increased complexity or additional costs.</li>
    </ul>
